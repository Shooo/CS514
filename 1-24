ename in employee table not null attribute

RDBMS properties
	1. Independence (Irrelevant how data is stored in hard drive)
	2. Concurrency 
	3. Persistent (Data doesn't dissapear) (back up and recovery)
	4. Integrity (DB should be able to help you trust in the fact data is correct)
		- doubly entry
		- constraints
			- primary key constraint (Cannot have multiple primary keys)

Schema

1 instance, many schemas

desc
select * from
name, redid, what we used (oracle live sql? etc) how we did the assignment



// not an sql command, no need for semicolon, psuedo command
desc empbb02

select * from empbb02;

empbb02 (empno VARCHAR2(5), ename VARCHAR2(10) NOT NULL)



// sets number of rows before reprinting
set pages 200
select *

'/' repeats the previous command (not pseudo command)



update empbb02 set sal = 2001 where ename = 'lasorda';

INSERT INTO tableName
UPDATE tableName SET
DELETE FROM tableName

insert into empbb02 values('222', null, null, null, null, null, null, null)
- this doesnt work because ename cannot be null (not null)

insert into empbb02 values('222', 'doe', null, null, null, null, null, null)

order which rows are displayed are not locked in 
rows are an unordered set, so you cannot insert into i



delete from empbb02 where empno='222';


// table creation
create table elites (a NUMBER(3), b, NUMBER(4,2));
Table created.

// table deletion
drop table elites purge;
// without 'purge' it will delete elite into the recycle bin
// used for persistence

// empties the recyclebin
purge recyclebin;



DATABASE CONSTRAINTS

key: set of attributes of a table
candidate key: a minimal key that uniquely identifies any row in a valid set of rows for a table, where minimal means that removing any column invalidates the preceding 
	ie: empno, uniform number
	- implies unique and not null
primary key: a selected candidate key

infotable, employee, department, candidate keys
info (everyone has to have uniform number with no duplicates - uni second candidate key)
no primary keys for the first assignment

how to specify a primary key
// we will not be using this way
create table emp(empno VARCHAR2(6) PRIMARY KEY, )

2nd way
describe all columns, add modifier specifying primary key
create table emp(a, b, c, d, PRIMARY KEY (a,d) )

3rd way
alter table empbb02 add constraint empbb02_empno_pk primary key(empno);
