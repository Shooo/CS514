cursorbb02a.sql

After CUSOR ... IS, initialization for the cursor

OPEN executes cursor

FETCH INTO

EXIT WHEN

CLOSE

nofrillscursor
understand this for midterm2


%.. = cursor attribute, something you can extract from a cursor

cursorbb02.sql
syntactic sugar

cursorbb02c.sql
active set in parenthesis

cursorbb02d.sql

parameterized declaration

start cursorbb02d.sql

cursorbb02e.sql

start cursorbb02

FOR UPDATE OF sal NOWAIT;
// allows updating of rows in active set

nowait - if somebody else has table, dont execute


cursorbb02f.sql

TYPE cursor_var IS REF CURSOR

REF CURSOR is a pointer to a cursor
a variable that can point to different cursors, to different active sets


cursorbb02g.sql

limits the domain of what the pointer can point to

should always return rows from the employee table


cursorbb02h.sql
anchored local variables
SYS_REFCURSOR - predefined cursor variable


cursorbb02m.sql
doent work

stored functions and stored procedures


getDnamebb02.fn

naming convention : .fn
You have to type .fn to start function as default is .sql

CREATE FUNCTION, if reran it will not work
CREATE OR REPLACE, if it already exists it will replace it, can run code multiple times


(name IN empbb02.ename%TYPE)

parameters, name is input variable

IN - input parameter

IN OUT

gdname - return name

block has a name = getDnamebb02
nonanonymous


"compile" the code that defines the algorithm can be preprocessed by oracle

how to compile and store code:
start the script that has the code

MIDTERM QUESTION ^^^^^^


getDnamebb02Test.sql
how to call the function:
SELECT ename,getDnamebb02(ename) AS "department name"


Compile:
start getdNamebb02.fn

Function created.

start getDnamebb02Test


getDnamebb02Test2.sql

EXECUTE
:deptname - local variable, bind

EXECUTE - syntatic sugar
you dont need begin declare and end
minimal anonymous block

no need for a plsql block with EXECUTE, just runs code
start getDnamebb02Test2


getDnamebb02Test3.sql

getDnamebb02Test4.sql

side effect


desc getDnamebb02
describes the stored function
