design constraints - business rules
also called key constraints
its called a key constraint because it can be implemented with database key constraints

at least on -> can also be refered to a  "total participation constraint"
employees MUST participate in a department


weak entity - entity without a primary key

if I know who the insurer is, all I need is the first name

parent table shows us which suzie is with which emp


hierarchy

ISA - similar to subclass, read bottom up

hourly employee is an employee
contract employee is an employee

subclasses must inherit parent stuff
square has a length and a width which sounds redundant when we already have side

DBMS once you use ISA, it will be a subentity

is square a subetntity of a rectangle? yes
is a square a subclass of a rectangle?? no


Ternary
???

departments sponsors projects (ie food drive)

sales department sponsors food drive
if sales department is inconsistent with its project, ie different number of boxes each year
we have an employee to monitor the project


relationship among relationship

The complex entity is known as an "Aggregation"


Binary vs Ternary

2nd version, everything is binary
joe purchases a policy that benefits susie
joe - employee, suzie - dependent

two binaries instead of one ternary, we have our arrows in binary
ternary we have 3

more arrows, we can finer tune the rules



black marker pen goes to dept from supplier
black marker - part

supplier haas contract with department for part ?
